coding conventions in icicle:
  - ...
  - KISS
  - no file should be longer than 100 lines :)
  - double space indentation (no tabs)
  - both opening and closing braces on separate lines
  - only Unix-style carriage returns ("\n")
  - avoiding preprocessor macros
  - "two or more, use a for" (E.W. Dijkstra)
  - declare local variables as near to their use as possible
  - avoid overly long lines...

- code organisation:
  - one class per one header file (CERN C05)
  - each header file should be self-contained (CERN C01)
  - avoid unnecessary inclusions (CERN C02)
  - protect header files from multiple inclusion (CERN C03)
  - avoid multiple inheritance (CERN CB5)
  - filenames reflecting class structure with underscore 
    indicating inheritance, e.g. adv_lax-wendroff.hpp
  - filenames should be all-lowercase

- identifier names:
  - all variable, class and method named are lowercase
    optionally with underscores
